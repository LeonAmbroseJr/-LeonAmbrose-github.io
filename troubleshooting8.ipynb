            "\n",
            "Based on the nature of these misfire codes (P0300 - random/multiple cylinder, P0302 - Cylinder 2, P0304 - Cylinder 4), here are recommended next steps:\n",
            "1. **Verify the Codes:** Use an OBD-II scanner to confirm the presence of these specific codes. Clear the codes and see if they return after driving the vehicle. Note any other pending or active codes as they might provide additional clues.\n",
            "2. **Inspect Spark Plugs and Ignition Coils:**\n",
            "   - For P0302 (Cylinder 2) and P0304 (Cylinder 4), directly inspect the spark plug and ignition coil in those specific cylinders. Look for signs of fouling, wear, or damage on the spark plug. Check the ignition coil for any cracks or signs of failure.\n",
            "   - For P0300 (Random/Multiple Misfire), while focusing on cylinders 2 and 4 is important due to the other codes, it's advisable to generally inspect all spark plugs and ignition coils as the issue could be more widespread.\n",
            "   - Consider swapping the ignition coil from a misfiring cylinder to a known good cylinder to see if the misfire follows the coil. This helps isolate a faulty coil.\n",
            "3. **Check for Vacuum Leaks:** Vacuum leaks are a common cause of P0300. Inspect all vacuum hoses and the intake manifold gaskets for cracks, disconnections, or signs of leaks. A vacuum leak can cause a lean air-fuel mixture, leading to misfires across multiple cylinders.\n",
            "4. **Investigate Fuel System:** Misfires can also be caused by fuel delivery issues. While more advanced, potential next steps include:\n",
            "   - Checking fuel pressure to ensure it is within the manufacturer's specifications.\n",
            "   - Considering the possibility of clogged or faulty fuel injectors, particularly for specific cylinder misfires (P0302, P0304). Fuel injector cleaning or testing may be necessary.\n",
            "5. **Consider Professional Help:**\n",
            "   - If you are not comfortable performing these diagnostic steps, do not have the necessary tools (like an OBD-II scanner, fuel pressure gauge), or if the initial steps do not resolve the issue, it is highly recommended to seek assistance from a qualified mechanic.\n",
            "   - Automotive repair can be complex, and incorrect diagnosis or repair can lead to further problems or damage.\n",
            "   - A professional can perform more in-depth testing, such as compression tests (to check for internal engine issues), advanced sensor diagnostics, and use specialized tools to pinpoint the root cause.\n"

        "- Fuel pump was replaced.\n",

Fuel delivery issues at the injector level can directly cause misfires in specific cylinders.\n",
